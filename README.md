# Inbetween

A 2.5D Survival Crafting Game. Explore the realm between life and death and find your way back to the living.

# How To Play

Your objective is to navigate through the world, looking for the portals that will get you closer to the way back to the world of the living. Pick up food items when you notice your hunger is running low (otherwise your health will begin deteriorating) and use health potions when you've taken too much damage. Store items in your inventory and craft news one when you've learned a new recipe. Attack enemies that get in your way as you try to look for a way out.

Controls:

- Movement - WASD or Directional Arrows
- Sprint - WASD or Directionals Arrows + Z
- Attack - Spacebar
- Inventory (open/close) - Q
